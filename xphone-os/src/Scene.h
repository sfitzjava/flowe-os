// xphone-os M1 — scene base class + purpose-built scene manager.
//
// One active scene, no stack, no FreeRTOS render task. E-ink discipline:
// scenes render ONLY when dirty (state changed), never periodically. M2.1a
// refresh policy (SceneManager::renderIfDirty): FULL on scene switches,
// PARTIAL window for small dirty rects (scenes report them via
// markDirty(rect)), FAST full-panel otherwise, and a HALF scrub after every
// kScrubAfterRefreshes differential updates to clear ghosting. All scenes are
// static instances — no heap.

#include "Gfx.h"
#include "Input.h"

// Soft-key labels that are ARROW MARKS rather than words.
//
// The UI fonts are ASCII+Latin subsets: U+2190.. simply have no glyph and
// would draw as "?" (Gfx::findGlyph falls back). So an arrow is a SHAPE the
// bar painter draws, and these one-byte sentinels are how a scene's plain
// static label table asks for one. Anything else is drawn as text.
//
// THE DIRECTION-KEY RULE (slots 2 and 3, the only pair that ever means
// "backward / forward"):
//   Portrait — slot 2 is the LEFT key, slot 3 the RIGHT one.
//   Landscape — the tab column runs UPWARD from slot 0, so slot 3 is the TOP
//   key and slot 2 the one below it.
// Because of that, every landscape pair is drawn VERTICALLY with the up
// arrow on slot 3, and a screen whose portrait pair reads back-then-forward
// left to right (page turn, list cursor, -1/+1) must SWAP which key does
// what when the panel turns — otherwise the arrow points away from the
// button you press. A scene owns that swap; ReaderScene::dirSwap() is the
// single place it is decided.
