// Reading stats, pages-first (docs/plans/2026-07-29-reading-stats-design.md).
//
// One ~1.5 KB stats.bin at /.xphone/stats.bin holds a 64-day ring of
// {day, pages, minutes} plus a 64-book table of lifetime totals — rewritten
// atomically (ProgressFile pattern) at each session flush. No append log, no
// scans: the grid band reads a preloaded struct, growth is bounded forever.
//
// Time costs nothing to record (two millis() reads per session, no wakeups),
// but PAGES are the honest e-ink metric — a turn is an observed event, time
// includes the fell-asleep tail (bounded by auto-sleep). The band shows pages;
// minutes ride along in the same records for the app's charts.
//
// The device has no RTC: "today" derives from the phone-synced ClockStore
// (yyyymmdd + minutes-into-day + millis() elapsed since sync). With no sync
// since boot (day == 0) sessions still update book totals but skip day/streak
// attribution rather than inventing dates.
